GlyGen_Glycosylated_Proteins,"Glycans are carbohydrate-based polymers made by all living organisms which are essential biomolecules serving structure, energy storage and system regulatory purposes. Glycosylation is the co-translational and post-translational modification process by which a carbohydrate is covalently attached to a target macromolecule such as a protein. The goal of Glygen is to address glycoscience questions that can currently be answered only by extensive literature-based research and manual browsing and data collection from diverse resources Thus, information about glycosylated proteins and the glycans that attach to them have been compiled, harmonized, and integrated from diverse international bioinformatics resources, including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), UniProt, the Protein Data Bank (PDB), UniCarbKB, and the GlyTouCan glycan structure repository. To create this gene set, we identify the genes that encode proteins which the carbohydrate  {insert glycan} attaches to.

GTEx_Aging_Sigs,"There are changes in gene expression which accompany the biological process of aging. In order to find potential signatures related to aging in {insert tissue}, we obtain the gene expression level of nearly 1000 individuals  in {insert tissue}. Out of these samples, we compare the expression levels of a younger population with an older population of individuals. The younger population are between the ages {insert younger age} while the older population are between the ages {insert older age}. As a result, we were able to obtain tissue-specific genes that are related to aging that are also differentially expressed ({up or down}-regulated) in {insert tissue}."
GTEx_Tissues,"The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and regulation. Samples were collected from 54 non-diseased tissue sites across nearly 1000 individuals, primarily for molecular assays including WGS, WES, and RNA-Seq. Remaining samples are available from the GTEx Biobank. The GTEx Portal provides open access to data including gene expression, QTLs, and histology images. To create this gene set we compared the gene expression levels in {insert tissue} across {insert sex} individuals in the {insert age group} age group to identify genes that are {insert up or down} expressed in {insert tissue} compared to other tissues.

IDG_Drug_Targets,"There are only approximately 4,000 genes that are considered part of the “druggable genome,” a set of genes encoding proteins that scientists can or predict they can modify using small-molecule compounds due to the ability of the drug to interact with the protein binding site. These proteins usually are from the ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and protein kinases protein families. To create this gene set, we identified genes that are target proteins for the drug {insert drug}.

KOMP2_Mouse_Phenotypes,"Gene knockouts provide clues about what a gene normally does. Researchers can knock out and compare the phenotypic characteristics of the knockout mice to wild type mice to infer what phenotypes are related to a given gene. In this study, we generate homozygous knockout strains for every protein coding gene in the mouse genome, producing 7 males and 7 females per gene. To provide baseline values for phenotypes, these mice are compared with wildtype mice that are continually tested using the same protocols. Our results show that the phenotype {insert phenotype here}, was observed when the genes in this gene set were knocked out and compared to the wild type mice."
LINCS_L1000_CRISPR_KO_Consensus_Sigs,"The LINCS L1000 project has collected gene expression profiles for thousands of perturbagens at a variety of time points, doses, and cell lines. The data was generated using the L1000 assay which is a low-cost, high-throughput, gene expression profiling technology. Cultured cell lines from various human tissues were  perturbed by CRISPR knockout of single genes and the corresponding transcriptional responses were measured. The data are processed through a computational workflow that converts raw fluorescence intensities into differential gene expression signatures. Hence, the L1000 assay directly measures a reduced representation of the transcriptome. To create this gene set, we obtain transcriptional signatures of perturbations by the CRISPR knockout of the gene {insert gene here}. These signatures were created by aggregating and averaging Level 4 data for biological replicates as defined by the signatures metadata. Thus, we are able to obtain the gene set of genes that are {insert direction} regulated  when  {insert gene here} is knocked out."
LINCS_L1000_Chem_Pert_Consensus_Sigs,"The LINCS L1000 project has collected gene expression profiles for thousands of perturbagens at a variety of time points, doses, and cell lines. The data was generated using the L1000 assay which is a low-cost, high-throughput, gene expression profiling technology. Cultured cell lines from various human tissues were treated with various chemical and genetic perturbations and the corresponding transcriptional responses were measured. The data are processed through a computational workflow that converts raw fluorescence intensities into differential gene expression signatures. Hence, the L1000 assay directly measures a reduced representation of the transcriptome. To create this gene set, we obtain transcriptional signatures of perturbations by the small molecule {insert chemical here} and where gene expression was measured by the L1000 assay. These signatures were created by aggregating Level 4 data for biological replicates as defined by the signatures metadata. Thus, we are able to obtain the gene set of genes that are {insert direction} regulated with the chemical perturbagen {insert chemical}."
MoTrPAC,"Exercise provides a robust physiological stimulus that evokes cross-talk among multiple tissues that when repeated regularly (i.e., training) improves physiological capacity, benefits numerous organ systems, and decreases the risk for premature mortality. However, a gap remains in identifying the detailed molecular signals induced by exercise that benefits health and prevents disease. The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to assess molecular changes that occur in response to physical activity. Here, we use preclinical and clinical studies to examine the systemic effects of endurance and resistance exercise across a range of ages and fitness levels by molecular probing of multiple tissues before and after acute and chronic exercise. From this multi-omic and bioinformatic analysis, a molecular map of exercise was established. To create this gene set, we compared the gene expression levels in the  {insert organ} in {sex} subjects before and after exercise of a duration of {exercise duration} to identify genes that were  {up or down} after the activity."
Metabolomics_Workbench_Metabolites,"A metabolite is a substance made or used when the body breaks down food, drugs or chemicals, or its own tissue (for example, fat or muscle tissue). This process, called metabolism, makes energy and the materials needed for growth, reproduction, and maintaining health. The Metabolomics Workbench is an effort to centralize metabolomics metadata and experimental data spanning various species and experimental platforms. Small molecule metabolites which are involved in various physiological processes, play an important role in the regulation and control and cellular function and disease.In this study, we investigate the genes that are related to the metabolite: {insert metabolite}.
