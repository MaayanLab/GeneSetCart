In crossing aging signatures we created from GTEx with proteins associated with specific glycosylations, we see that there are 37 genes/proteins that significantly overlap between the glycan G48414YA and GTEx aging signatures from blood.

We can examine the overlapping gene set with tools such as Enrichr:

We can also give see from the GPT generated hypothesis that this glycan G48414YA is likely involved in blood clotting that is associated with aging:
